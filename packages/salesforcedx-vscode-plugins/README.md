Currently, Visual Studio Code extensions are not signed or verified on the Microsoft Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Salesforce provides the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) of each extension that we publish. Consult [Manually Verify the salesforcedx-vscode Extensionsâ€™ Authenticity](https://developer.salesforce.com/media/vscode/SHA256.md) to learn how to verify the extensions.
